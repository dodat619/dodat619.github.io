Hello. I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Statistics at the University of Michigan, where I am
fortunate to be advised by Professor [Jonathan Terhorst](https://jthlab.github.io/) and Professor [Long Nguyen](https://dept.stat.lsa.umich.edu/~xuanlong/).
Before coming to the University of Michigan, I graduated as the valedictorian of Hanoi
University of Science, class of 2019.

Here is a current version of my CV: 

## Research Interest

A central theme of my research focuses on:

* Hierarchical Models: Identifiability, Statistical Efficiency, and Model Selection
Methods
